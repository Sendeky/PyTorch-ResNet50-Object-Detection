# PyTorch-ResNet50-Object-Detection
## TLDR:
* I am trying to understand how to make a Object Detector in PyTorch.  
* I decided to use the KITTI and BDD100k datasets to train it on object detection.  
* In the future I plan to make a HydraNet ([paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Mullapudi_HydraNets_Specialized_Dynamic_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf) and
  [article](https://phucnsp.github.io/blog/self-taught/2020/04/30/tesla-nn-in-production.html)) based off of this that does object detection and depth estimation.
